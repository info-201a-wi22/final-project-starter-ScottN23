## Abstract
Our driving question is “What is the impact of COVID-19 on people’s physical and mental health with relation to sleep quality?” This question is important because current resources about this issue are scarce and we want to provide more accessibility to data and resources as a group. To address this question, we will find available datasets that allow us to critically analyze the data and provide insights about how sleep is impaired under stress due to COVID-19. 

## Introduction
In the midst of 2020, a severe pandemic broke out all around the world affecting everyone. Families were affected in multiple ways whether it be physically, mentally, financially, and more. The Coronavirus or COVID-19 also has significant effects on physical wellbeing. As a group, we found that negative mental health can be derived from chronic stress and poor quality of sleep. While these two parts play a role in mental health, together they have adverse consequences towards stress. We figured that throughout the past two years, positive mental health is at a declination. For our project proposal, we have ventured in a direction to create methods in providing accessible data and resources to educate folks upon the effects of COVID-19 on different populations. Specifically, we are focusing on the correlation of socialization, quality of sleep, and COVID-19.

## Design Sitatuion 
**Project Framing:** For our group, the goals for this project is to extract the data provided to us from the “Boston College daily sleep and well-being survey data” designed by Tony Cunningham, Eric Fields, and Elizabeth Kensinger and then reconstruct and present the data in a format that is easy to understand in order to draw conclusions of the impact of COVID-19 on the individuals sleep and mental and physical health. <br /> **Human Values:** Within this project we are going to be focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on the lives of the people that were surveyed within the data set we are using. We are hoping to find the relationship between COIVD-19 and the impacts on the individuals social interactions alongside their mental and physical health as a result of COVID-19. We are deciding to work on this dataset as COVID-19 has heavily affected all of us and we wanted to provide people information on how it has impacted others as well as we are all going through this together. Within this, we find human values as the ability for individuals to have control of their life style however, COVID-19 has placed constraints on everyone’s lives. <br /> **Stakeholders:** The direct stakeholders for our topic of the impact of COVID-19 on sleep and mental and physical health would be data analysts who use the data, the viewers of that data, the individuals surveyed, and the people who would use the data. These people share the knowledge of what the data holds and the goals of the data. For the indirect stakeholders we would say that they are the individuals who could be impacted by the usage of the data whether that be the citizens of an area that a government official uses the data in or somewhere else. <br /> **Possible Benefits & Harms:** The possible benefits of this data is that governments or companies could use the data to provide help for the general public or workers as they would have a deeper understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of many individuals which could result in change in the places this is used within. Possible harms for the data is that it could be used to make wrong claims about the impacts of COVID-19 that may downplay the actual effect of COVID-19 which would result in a loss of opportunity to help the individuals severely affected by the pandemic. 

## Research Questions
**What’s the correlation between sleep quality and COVID-19?**
**What’s the relationship between sleep quality and socialization?**
**What’s the connection between sleep quality and mental health, particularly during COVID-19 time? What's the impact of COVID-19 on an individual's physical health?** 
**What's the impact of COVID-19 on the stress level of an individual?** 

## Relevance of Research Questions
We think these questions are important because we understand that COVID-19 has had a large effect on the lifestyles of many individuals and the isolation has significantly impacted many. Whether it had been because of unemployment, isolation, or being exposed to covid itself, COVID-19 has changed the way we live. Particularly, these questions are also important to answer as they will help us understand the impact of stress on sleep and mental health and how COVID-19 has triggered these negative feelings. Knowing these information would allow medical practitioners to help patients to better cope with mental stressors and live a healthier life. We will address these questions by working with the datasets and analyzing them so we can examine the impacts of COVID-19 on varying aspects of individual lives.

## Implications 
Our project focuses on the relationship between COVID and sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and mental health. Assuming a positive correlation between the spread and positive test result of COVID with these attributes, we suggest that policy makers and schools pay extra attention to alcohol consumption in families, particularly, they should make sure that teenagers and young adults do not develop the habit of consuming alcohol as a coping mechanism during this time. Furthermore, lots of institutions are already doing this, but it is crucial to attend to students and employees who express stress and anxiety that need time off for mental health reasons since the sorrow this pandemic has put on everyone is already burdensome. We also encourage policymakers to design reasonable homework workloads in schools to make sure children and teenagers are getting enough sleep and rest.

## Limitations
The researchers stated in their original article that the sample of this study was primarily comprised of white females who are well-educated and from the United States (Massachusetts to be more specific). With that being said, this is going to limit the generalizability of the research finding to other regions of the world, other genders, and ethnicities.  This dataset also contains problems of response bias since users might not submit responses on days when they don’t feel well; subjective assessment which is the nature of this type of study, heavily relied on self-report.

**Chart explains the COVID-19 Impact on Mental Health. Here, it relates the average total levels of stress to mental health. Here it depicts the difference in mental stress between people with COVID-19 and without COVID-19. Within the chart it depict that those who contracted COVID-19 typically have a higher isolation, stress, and worry level.**

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
